Alyson and Alex met rock climbing on the UW Madison campus when they were introduced by a mutual friend.
The moment she asked if he could help her debug a Python program, Alex knew she was the one.
In the next two years they went on their fair share of adventures and finally Alex worked up the courage to ask her on date.

Boyfriend/girlfriend quickly turned into fiance when he proposed to her in December 2014.
Alyson was so surprised when he pulled the ring out, she dropped the bottle of wine they were bringing home and Alex went down on one knee in a puddle.
She said yes, and the rest is history.
