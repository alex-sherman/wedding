We have reserved blocks of rooms in two hotels within walking distance of the Madison Club.
The blocks will remain exclusive to our guests up until three weeks before the event.
Please book before that time since there is another large event the weekend of the wedding.

In order to reserve rooms in either hotel under the block, please use the reservation code from your save the date.
The code will only apply if you book to check in on the 12th and check out on the 14th.
